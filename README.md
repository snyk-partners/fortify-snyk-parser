## Usage
To use the Snyk Parser Plugin, cli scan results in `.json` format should be generated.
```
snyk test --json > scan.json
```
and an app version should be declared (in: `http://127.0.0.1:8180/ssc/html/ssc/version`).
If you don't have any, just create one (click `NEW APPLICATION` and then fill out info).
### Using the web UI
1. Generate `scan.zip` scan results files. Alongside `scan.json` execute:
```
echo "engineType=SNYK" > scan.info
zip -v scan.zip scan.json scan.info
```
2. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8180/ssc/html/ssc/version` and select the version to bind the report to.
and click on the application you want to bind the scan results to.
3. Click `ARTIFACTS` tab and there click `ARTIFACT`.
4. Click `ADD FILES` and select the `scan.zip` you just made. Then click `START UPLOAD`. `CLOSE` to close the window.
5. Once results were successfully processed, you should see status `Processing Complete` for the uploaded `scan.zip`.
### Using the REST API
Alongside the `scan.json`:
```
curl --noproxy localhost -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u admin:<PASSWORD> -d '{"fileTokenType": "UPLOAD"}' http://localhost:8180/ssc/api/v1/fileTokens
curl --noproxy localhost -X POST --form files=@"scan.json" "http://localhost:8180/ssc/upload/resultFileUpload.html?mat=<TOKEN>&entityId=<APP_ID>&engineType=SNYK" 
```
`APP_ID` is the id number of the app version, in the url when going to an app dashboard `http://localhost:8180/ssc/html/ssc/version/<APP_ID>/`
### Viewing results
1. In the app version dashboard (`http://localhost:8180/ssc/html/ssc/version/<APP_ID>/`).
2. Click on `AUDIT` tab at the top and you should see all issues reported by Snyk in the table.
3. Click on any row to reveal detailed information on issue.
